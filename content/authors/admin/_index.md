I am a 4th year Doctoral Candidate in the <a href="https://foersterlab.com">FLAIR</a> and <a href="https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/">WHIRL</a> labs at the 
<a href="https://ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. I am also a member of the 
<a href="https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/">AIMS CDT</a>. I am interested in properly evaluating
and understanding the training of agents, mostly using reinforcement learning.

I previously worked as a software engineer for <a href="https://www.man.com/ahl">Man AHL</a> for two years, where I worked in the Core Trading Technology team. Before that I did my masters and 
undergraduate degrees in computer science at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk">University of Cambridge</a>.
